<h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
<p><strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below, you will find an overview of the legal bases under the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence. If specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you of them in this privacy policy.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Contract fulfillment and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, or to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third country (outside the EU and Switzerland):</strong> Data protection regulations in the country of the controller's residence apply in addition to or alongside the GDPR. These regulations may contain specific provisions that go beyond or differ from the GDPR requirements. These include, among others, rules for protection against misuse of personal data, regulations for access and deletion rights, objection rights, processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, transfers, and automated decision-making, including profiling.</p>

<h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
<p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures, considering the state of the art, implementation costs, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
<p>These measures include ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access, input, transmission, availability, and separation of the data concerning them. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subject rights, deletion of data, and response to data threats. We also consider the protection of personal data during the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures in accordance with the principles of data protection, by design and by default.</p>
<p>Securing online connections using TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect users' data transmitted through our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), ensuring that data is protected from unauthorized access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transfers meet the highest security standards. A website secured by an SSL/TLS certificate is indicated by HTTPS in the URL, signaling to users that their data is securely and encryptedly transmitted.</p>
<h2 id="m25">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
<p>In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that such data is transmitted to other locations, companies, legally independent organizational units, or persons, or disclosed to them. Recipients of these data may include, for example, service providers tasked with IT responsibilities or providers of services and content integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude corresponding contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data, which serve to protect your data.</p>

<h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)), or if processing occurs within the framework of using third-party services or disclosure/transfer of data to other persons, offices, or companies, this is done only in accordance with legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third country is recognized by an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for the data transfer. Otherwise, data transfers will only take place if the level of data protection is otherwise guaranteed, particularly through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR), explicit consent, or in cases of contractual or legally required transfer (Art. 49(1) GDPR). Furthermore, we inform you of the basis for the transfer to a third country for individual service providers from the third country, whereby adequacy decisions take precedence. Information about third-country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be obtained from the EU Commission's information offering: <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de" target="_blank">https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de</a>. Under the "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission also recognized the level of data protection for certain companies in the USA as secure under the adequacy decision of 10 July 2023. The list of certified companies and further information on the DPF can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a> (in English). We inform you in our privacy notices which of the service providers we use are certified under the Data Privacy Framework.</p>

<h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
<p>We delete personal data we process in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the underlying consents are revoked, or there are no further legal grounds for processing. This applies in cases where the original purpose of processing no longer applies, or the data is no longer required. Exceptions to this rule exist when statutory obligations or special interests require longer storage or archiving of the data.</p>
<p>Specifically, data that must be retained for commercial or tax purposes, or whose storage is necessary for legal enforcement or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons, must be archived accordingly.</p>
<p>Our privacy notices include additional information on the storage and deletion of data specific to particular processing operations.</p>
<p>If there are multiple storage durations or deletion deadlines for a given piece of data, the longest duration shall always apply.</p>
<p>If a deadline does not explicitly begin on a certain date and is at least one year, it automatically starts at the end of the calendar year in which the triggering event occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in which data is stored, the triggering event is the effective date of termination or other ending of the legal relationship.</p>
<p>Data that is no longer required for the originally intended purpose but is retained for statutory reasons or other justified interests is processed solely for the reasons justifying their retention.</p>

<h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
<p>Data subjects' rights under the GDPR: As a data subject, you have various rights under the GDPR, specifically as outlined in Articles 15 to 21 of the GDPR:</p>

If personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing; this also applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> You have the right to withdraw any consent given at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to request confirmation as to whether personal data concerning you is being processed and to access such data as well as additional information and copies of the data in accordance with legal requirements.</li>

<h2 id="m136">Social Media Presence</h2>
<p>We maintain online presences on social networks and process user data in this context to communicate with active users there or to offer information about us.</p>
<p>Please note that user data may be processed outside the territory of the European Union. This can entail risks for users, for instance, the enforcement of user rights could be more difficult.</p>
<p>Additionally, user data within social networks is generally processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user behavior and interests may be used to create user profiles. These profiles may be used to display advertisements, both within and outside the networks, that are presumed to correspond to user interests. Typically, cookies are stored on users’ devices to record user behavior and interests. User profiles may also store data independent of the devices used (especially if users are members of the respective platforms and logged in).</p>
<p>For detailed descriptions of the respective forms of processing and options for objection (opt-out), please refer to the privacy policies and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.</p>
<p>We also point out that in the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, these are most effectively addressed directly to the providers. Only the providers have access to user data and can take direct action and provide information. If you still need assistance, you can contact us.</p>
