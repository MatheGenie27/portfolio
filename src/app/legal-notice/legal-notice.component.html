        <p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong><br><br><strong>Liability for Contents</strong><br><br>
            The contents of our pages were created with the greatest care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or up-to-dateness of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own contents on these pages in accordance with § 7 para. 1 DDG and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances indicating illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such legal violations, we will remove these contents immediately.<br><br><strong>Liability for Links</strong><br><br>
            Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for their content. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not identifiable at the time of linking. A permanent content control of the linked pages is, however, not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.<br><br><strong>Copyright</strong><br><br>
            The contents and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. Reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. As far as the contents on this site were not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, contents of third parties are marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, we ask for a corresponding notification. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such contents immediately.<br><br><strong>Data Protection</strong><br><br>
            The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g., name, address, or email addresses) are collected on our pages, this is done, as far as possible, on a voluntary basis. These data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.<br>
            We point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g., when communicating via email) can have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.<br>
            The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited advertising, such as spam emails.<br>
